We go to restaurants to enjoy food, celebrate and have memorable moments. A majority of restaurateurs incorrectly assume that if a restaurant serves good quality food, that is enough to manage a profitable venture. Besides the quality contributions, you should focus your restaurant and turn it into a name that clients can trust.

But the study also pointed out that if the restaurant survived the first year, then only 14% and 7% such restaurants close in the second and third year respectively. A recent study by Cornell University estimates the failure rate even higher. The study shows that 60% of restaurants are closed in the first year.
